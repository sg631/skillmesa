# Skillmesa

Skillmesa is an app for teenagers to find and share courses and services, ranging from mowing lawns to babysitting and math tutoring. It allows kids to share skills they might not otherwise be able to and is perfect for middle and high school students to offer their services and skills on a centralized platform within a community where they belong.
